This exercise is about the well-known Monty Hall problem. In the problem, you are a con-
testant on a game show. The host, Monty Hall, shows you three doors. Behind one of those
doors is a prize, and behind the other two doors are goats. You pick a door. Monty Hall, who
knows behind which door the prize lies, then opens up one of the doors that doesnâ€™t contain
the prize. There are now two doors left, and Monty gives you the opportunity to change your
choice. Should you keep the same door, change doors, or does it not matter?
(a) Write a program that simulates playing this game 10000 times and calculates what per-
centage of the time you would win if you switch and what percentage of the time you
would win by not switching.
(b) Try the above but with four doors instead of three. There is still only one prize, and
Monty still opens up one door and then gives you the opportunity to switch.
